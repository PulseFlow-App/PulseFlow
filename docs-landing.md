# What Pulse Is

Pulse is a wellness app that turns food, movement, and body data into one simple daily signal. Most health tools scatter your information across dashboards and metrics. Pulse connects it into a single score that helps you understand your day without extra effort. It is built for people who want clarity, not more complexity.

## The Core Idea

Your body responds to everyday inputs: what you eat, how you move, how you sleep, how you feel. Those inputs are often logged somewhere, but rarely turned into something useful.

Pulse assumes you do not need more data. You need less noise and one clear signal. The goal is consistency, not perfection. The system is built to support daily habits, not to push you toward an idealized version of yourself.

## How Pulse Works

You log your day: meals, movement, sleep, mood, or body metrics. You choose what to share. Pulse uses that to learn your baseline over time. It does not compare you to population averages. It compares you to you.

As you add data, Pulse reflects your current state. The signal updates. Over time, it adapts. The more you use it, the more it understands your patterns. There are no hidden algorithms to decode. The flow is: you log, Pulse learns, Pulse reflects, Pulse adapts.

## The Daily Pulse Score

The Daily Pulse is a number from 0 to 100. It represents how your inputs are lining up on a given day: food, movement, recovery, and how you feel. A higher number does not mean you are "healthy" or "good." It means your recent inputs and your baseline are in a better alignment. A lower number does not mean failure. It means something is off, and it is worth noticing.

The score is not a diagnosis. It is not a grade. It is not tied to weight or appearance. It is a daily readout. Simplicity is the point. One number reduces the need to interpret many.

## What You Can Track

You can log any combination of the following. Pulse uses what you give it. None of it is required.

- **Food.** Meals, ingredients, or photos of what you have. Pulse uses this to see patterns in how you eat and how it relates to the rest of your data.
- **Movement.** Workouts, steps, or activity from connected devices. Movement affects recovery and energy. Pulse connects it to the score.
- **Sleep and recovery.** Hours, quality, or how rested you feel. Recovery shapes the next day. Pulse factors it in.
- **Body signals.** Weight, optional body composition, or how your body feels. These are inputs, not judgments. Trends matter more than single points.
- **Mood and energy.** Simple check-ins. They help Pulse understand how inputs and the score line up with how you actually feel.

The goal of tracking is to feed the signal. You decide what to log. Pulse does the rest.

## Intelligence, Not Automation

Pulse does not replace your judgment. It does not tell you what to do. It helps you notice patterns you might miss on your own. It surfaces connections between food, movement, sleep, and how you feel.

The system adapts to you. It is not built on generic averages. It learns your baselines and adjusts as your data grows. Recommendations and insights evolve. They get more relevant over time because they are based on your history, not someone else's.

## Privacy and Data Ownership

You own your data. Pulse does not sell it. We do not share it with advertisers or third parties for marketing. What you log stays yours.

Where possible, we keep data local or encrypted. Permissions are explicit. You choose what to connect, what to upload, and what to remove. You can export your data. Trust is not assumed; it is built through transparent behavior.

---

## Access and Participation

There is a free tier. You can use core tracking, see your Daily Pulse, and get basic insights without paying. That is enough for many people.

Advanced features — deeper analysis, long-term trends, personalized recommendations, and more — unlock when you hold or stake Pulse tokens. Participation is rewarded with capability. There are no paywalls that block core value. If you pay or participate, you receive something clearly in return.

## Roadmap

### MVP 1

Core tracking for food, movement, sleep, and body. The Daily Pulse score. Basic insights and patterns. Enough to use Pulse every day and see the signal.

### MVP 2

Adaptive intelligence that improves with your history. Long-term trends and comparisons. Richer recommendations. The system becomes more useful the longer you use it.

## Who Pulse Is For

Pulse is for people who want clarity instead of dashboards. For people tired of apps that add noise. For people who value consistency over perfection. For people who want one daily signal, not twenty metrics to interpret.

It is not for people who want a medical tool. It is not for people who want a social or gamified experience. It is for people who are willing to log a bit in exchange for a calmer relationship with their own data.

---

## Closing

Pulse is being built slowly, carefully, and in public. We are not promising outcomes. We are building a tool that respects your data, reduces noise, and gives you one clear signal to work with. If that interests you, you are welcome to try it.
