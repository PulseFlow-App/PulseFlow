                    What Pulse Is
                </h1>
                <p class="text-lg text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
                    Pulse is a wellness app that turns food, movement, and body data into one simple daily signal. Most health tools scatter your information across dashboards and metrics. Pulse connects it into a single score that helps you understand your day without extra effort. It is built for people who want clarity, not more complexity.

            <!-- 1. THE CORE IDEA -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-white mb-6 tracking-tight">
                    The Core Idea
                </h2>
                <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
                    Your body responds to everyday inputs: what you eat, how you move, how you sleep, how you feel. Those inputs are often logged somewhere, but rarely turned into something useful.
                </p>
                <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
                    Pulse assumes you do not need more data. You need less noise and one clear signal. The goal is consistency, not perfection. The system is built to support daily habits, not to push you toward an idealized version of yourself.
                </p>

            <!-- 2. HOW PULSE WORKS -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-white mb-6 tracking-tight">
                    How Pulse Works
                </h2>
                <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
                    You log your day: meals, movement, sleep, mood, or body metrics. You choose what to share. Pulse uses that to learn your baseline over time. It does not compare you to population averages. It compares you to you.
                </p>
                <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
                    As you add data, Pulse reflects your current state. The signal updates. Over time, it adapts. The more you use it, the more it understands your patterns. There are no hidden algorithms to decode. The flow is: you log, Pulse learns, Pulse reflects, Pulse adapts.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- 3. THE DAILY PULSE SCORE -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-white mb-6 tracking-tight">
                    The Daily Pulse Score
                </h2>
                <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
                    The Daily Pulse is a number from 0 to 100. It represents how your inputs are lining up on a given day: food, movement, recovery, and how you feel. A higher number does not mean you are "healthy" or "good." It means your recent inputs and your baseline are in a better alignment. A lower number does not mean failure. It means something is off, and it is worth noticing.
                </p>
                <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
                    The score is not a diagnosis. It is not a grade. It is not tied to weight or appearance. It is a daily readout. Simplicity is the point. One number reduces the need to interpret many.
                </p>

            <!-- 4. WHAT YOU CAN TRACK -->

                    What You Can Track
                </h2>
                <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    You can log any combination of the following. Pulse uses what you give it. None of it is required.
                </p>
                <ul class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed list-disc">
                    <li><strong class="text-neutral-200">Food.</strong> Meals, ingredients, or photos of what you have. Pulse uses this to see patterns in how you eat and how it relates to the rest of your data.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-neutral-200">Movement.</strong> Workouts, steps, or activity from connected devices. Movement affects recovery and energy. Pulse connects it to the score.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-neutral-200">Sleep and recovery.</strong> Hours, quality, or how rested you feel. Recovery shapes the next day. Pulse factors it in.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-neutral-200">Body signals.</strong> Weight, optional body composition, or how your body feels. These are inputs, not judgments. Trends matter more than single points.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-neutral-200">Mood and energy.</strong> Simple check-ins. They help Pulse understand how inputs and the score line up with how you actually feel.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
                    The goal of tracking is to feed the signal. You decide what to log. Pulse does the rest.

                </h2>
                <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
                    Pulse does not replace your judgment. It does not tell you what to do. It helps you notice patterns you might miss on your own. It surfaces connections between food, movement, sleep, and how you feel.
                </p>
                <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
                    The system adapts to you. It is not built on generic averages. It learns your baselines and adjusts as your data grows. Recommendations and insights evolve. They get more relevant over time because they are based on your history, not someone else's.

                    Pulse is for people who want clarity instead of dashboards. For people tired of apps that add noise. For people who value consistency over perfection. For people who want one daily signal, not twenty metrics to interpret.

                    It is not for people who want a medical tool. It is not for people who want a social or gamified experience. It is for people who are willing to log a bit in exchange for a calmer relationship with their own data.
