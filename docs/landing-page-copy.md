## Hero

**Headline:** Your daily wellness pulse.

**Subhead:** One score. Clear insights. Less noise.

**CTA:** Get started → app.pulseflow.site

---

## Feature bullets (main value)

- **Daily Pulse score** — One number (0–100) for how your body is doing today; updates as you log, based on your baseline.
- **Body signals & routine** — Log sleep, energy, mood; get short, actionable insights instead of raw charts.
- **AI that explains** — "What this means today" in plain language; suggestions you can act on.
- **Premium** — Unlimited requests, long-term trends, personal baselines; subscribe in the app.
- **Your data** — Encrypted, exportable, never sold; you choose what to connect.

---

## Short bullets (compact list)

- One daily score (0–100) — your body, your baseline.
- Body signals and routine check-ins — sleep, energy, mood.
- Clear, actionable insights — not more dashboards.
- Premium: unlimited requests, trends, baselines (subscribe in-app).
- Your data stays yours — encrypted, exportable, never sold.

---

## Optional "About Pulse" (off-app only)

**Line:** Pulse is an app you can use every day. $PULSE is how the system evolves.

**Bullets:** governance, Pulse Lab, rewards, "You don't need crypto to use Pulse."

---

## Avoid on main landing

- "Stake to unlock"
- "Connect wallet"
- "Buy $PULSE"
- Token-gated copy

Use these only in docs, token pages, or app flows — not on the main marketing landing.
